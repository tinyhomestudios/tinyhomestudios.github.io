# Welcome!

Welcome to our new website! We've decided to make a departure from the hard-coded themes in **Squarespace** and instead focus on the simpler templates and design provided through **Jekyll**.

It's been a while since we released *Tiny Home VR*, and we've since taken a small step back while we readjust our focus. We're grateful to those who played the game, and hope that these moments provided some sense of calm, tranquillity, and a chance to recover from everything that's happening around us. We haven't provided as much additional content as planned, but hopefully there's something for everybody.

Beyond our app, the excitement since the launch of the [Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/), and Apple entering the market with spatial computing and the [Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), has reinjected a sense of optimism in the space from our non-core audience. This has also invigorated us, and we hope to share more regarding new content soon!
